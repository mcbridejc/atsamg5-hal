# atsamg5-hal

This project aims to create a HAL and peripheral access crates for the ATSAMG5x microcontroller series. 

The PACs are straightforward and automatically generated from the microchip provided SVD files; they should be complete. 

The HAL is very incomplete and should be considered unproven.
